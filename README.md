# MedikinetCalculator

This is a simple calculator that helps individuals with a variation of ADHD (Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder) to determine the approximate time of effect of Medikinet, a commonly prescribed medication for ADHD.

I just had some of my creative minutes. Here is what my brain has created so far as idea :D

NOT RUNNING, Current Stage: Project init

Project plans:
 - Node JS API
 - Fancy, modern and beautiful looking frontend
 - Flutter app for android and ios
 
General features planned:
 - Time of Effect
 - Graph which would show the approximate time when the highest effects take start
 - Related information, warnings, recommended maximal dosages
 
Some fancy functions that are planned (Flutter app):
 - Local and heavily encrypted storage of some user data (If the user wants to use these features). User can save time and dosage of medication. The app will later be having a dashboard as home on which the approximate remaining effect and the approximate remaining strength according to the dosage and other data will be left.
 - Push notification for reminder (For example configured with time and remaining effect and strength)
 - Saving of acutual effect, feeling according to the user.
 - Easy to export data for be able to get viewed by a doctor if the user want it. (Encrypted and protected)
 - For doctor, import of patient data (Encrypted and protected)
 - ...
 
 Privacy protection:
  - No personal data will be sent to the server. If something like that would be done in the future, the user needs to really consent to that first. But anyway everthing would be encrypted with the best latest encryption technology.
